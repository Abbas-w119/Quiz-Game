This is a console-based quiz application built using C++ that allows users to test their knowledge across multiple categories and difficulty levels.
Offers two levels: Easy and Hard.
Each level includes three categories:
Easy: Capitals, General Knowledge, Maths
Hard: Programming, Science, History
Each quiz contains 15 multiple-choice questions.
Users can quit anytime by entering 0.
Correct answers increase the score; final score is displayed at the end.
User results are saved to a file user_records.txt.
Option to search previous user scores by name.
Uses struct, vector, file I/O, and modular functions for logic.
