Console-Based Quiz Game in C++
<br>
This is a console-based quiz application built using C++ that allows users to test their knowledge across multiple categories and difficulty levels. The quiz offers two levels: Easy and Hard. Each level includes three categoriesâ€”Capitals, General Knowledge, and Maths under Easy, and Programming, Science, and History under Hard. Each quiz contains 15 multiple-choice questions, and users can quit at any time by entering 0. Correct answers increase the score, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz. User results are saved to a file named user_records.txt, and there is also an option to search for previous user scores by name. The program utilizes C++ features such as struct, vector, file I/O, and modular functions to organize the quiz logic effectively.
